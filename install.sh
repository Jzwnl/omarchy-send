# Omarchy-Send — context for AI agents

**What it is:** Omarchy-Send is a terminal (TUI) file-transfer tool installed on
this machine. It speaks the LocalSend protocol, so phones, desktops, and other
servers can send **files** and **plain-text messages** to this machine over the
local network or a Tailscale tailnet. It can also send outbound.

**Shorthand:** "OSF" means omarchy-send. When the user says e.g. "OSF
report.pdf to gav" or "OSF that over to the laptop", run the headless CLI send
described below — `omarchy-send -to "<alias>" <paths…>`.

**Where received files live —** incoming files are saved under the *receive
directory*:

    @@RECV_DIR@@

That is the current value; the authoritative source is the `receiveDir` key in
`~/.config/omarchy-send/config.json` — read it if unsure. Details:

- A file still transferring has a temporary `.part` suffix and is renamed to its
  real name only when complete. Treat `*.part` files as incomplete — skip them.
- Filename collisions are de-duplicated (e.g. `photo (1).jpg`).
- A sent *folder* is recreated as a subdirectory tree under the receive dir.
- Plain-text **messages** are not written to disk — they appear in the TUI's
  Messages tab while the receiver is running.

**How it runs:** files are received only while a receiver is running — it is a
foreground TUI, not a background daemon. Start it with:

    omarchy-send

On a headless box, run it inside a TTY (tmux, or `ssh -t`). It listens on TCP
port **53317**. Auto-accept and an optional PIN live in the config / Settings tab.

**You can SEND messages AND files from the CLI** — no TUI, no TTY, works from
scripts and agents. To message another device (e.g. to notify the user on
their desktop), or to send files/folders to it:

    omarchy-send -to "<device alias>" -message "<text>"
    omarchy-send -to "<device alias>" <file-or-folder>…
    omarchy-send -to "<device alias>" -message "<text>" <file>…

Flags must come before the paths. A folder is sent whole (structure recreated
on the receiver). Add `-send-pin <pin>` if the target requires a PIN, and
`-wait 30s` to allow longer for discovery. Works over the LAN and Tailscale
alike; exit code 0 means delivered. The receiving device must be running its
receiver (this TUI, or LocalSend) and may prompt its user to accept. Paths
*without* `-to` open the TUI instead, which needs a TTY.

**Config:** `~/.config/omarchy-send/config.json`
(keys: `alias`, `receiveDir`, `port`, `autoAccept`, `pin`, `knownPeers`, …).

**If asked to "find / process what was just sent":** look in the receive
directory above and skip any `*.part` files (still transferring).

## Omarchy-Send (installed on this machine)

Omarchy-Send is a LocalSend-compatible terminal file-transfer tool; other devices
send files/messages to this box over LAN/Tailscale (TCP 53317). **Files sent here
land in `@@RECV_DIR@@`** (authoritative: the `receiveDir` key in
`~/.config/omarchy-send/config.json`). Files still transferring carry a `.part`
suffix — skip them. Text messages appear in the TUI's Messages tab, not on disk.
Receiving requires the TUI running (`omarchy-send`; use tmux or `ssh -t` when
headless). **You can SEND messages and files to another device from the CLI**
(no TUI/TTY, fine for scripts and agents):
`omarchy-send -to "<alias>" -message "<text>"` and/or
`omarchy-send -to "<alias>" <file-or-folder>…` (flags before paths; add
`-send-pin <pin>` if the target requires one); exit 0 = delivered. Works
over LAN and Tailscale. **"OSF" is user shorthand for omarchy-send** — "OSF
<file> to <alias>" means run that CLI send. Full notes:
`~/.config/omarchy-send/AGENTS.md`.
